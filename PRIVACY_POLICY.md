# Privacy Policy for SplitMate

**Last Updated: December 30, 2025**

## Introduction

Welcome to SplitMate ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our app. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the SplitMate mobile application (the "App").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide Directly

- **Mate Names**: Names or nicknames of people you add to split bills with. These are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.
- **Receipt Data**: Item names, prices, and split assignments that you enter manually or that are extracted from scanned receipts.
- **Receipt Titles and Dates**: Custom titles and dates you assign to your saved receipts.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Receipt Images (Temporary)**: When you use the receipt scanning feature, images of your receipts are temporarily transmitted to our servers for AI-powered text extraction. These images are processed in real-time and are **not stored** on our servers after processing is complete.
- **Theme Preferences**: Your selected app theme (light, dark, or system) is stored locally on your device.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do **not** collect your name, email address, or any personal contact information
- We do **not** require account registration or login
- We do **not** collect location data
- We do **not** collect device identifiers for advertising purposes
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking SDKs
- We do **not** display advertisements

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely to provide and improve the App's functionality:

| Data Type | Purpose | Storage Location |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Mate Names | To assign items and calculate split amounts | Device only |
| Receipt Data | To save and display your bill splits | Device only |
| Receipt Images | To extract item names and prices using AI | Processed in real-time, not stored |
| Theme Preference | To display your preferred color scheme | Device only |

## Third-Party Services

### Google Gemini AI

We use Google's Gemini AI service to analyze receipt images and extract item information. When you scan a receipt:

1. The receipt image is securely transmitted to our server
2. Our server sends the image to Google Gemini AI for text extraction
3. Only the extracted item names and prices are returned to your device
4. The image is immediately discarded after processing

Google's use of this data is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not share any other personal information with Google.

### No Other Third Parties

We do not share your data with any other third-party services, analytics providers, or advertising networks.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All your personal data (mates, receipts, preferences) is stored locally on your device using secure device storage. This data:

- Never leaves your device (except receipt images during scanning)
- Is not backed up to our servers
- Is not accessible to us
- Is deleted when you uninstall the App

### Server Processing

Our servers:

- Only receive receipt images temporarily for AI processing
- Do not store receipt images after processing
- Do not log or retain image data
- Use HTTPS encryption for all data transmission
- Implement rate limiting and security headers to protect against attacks

## Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention Period |
|-----------|------------------|
| Receipt Images | Deleted immediately after AI processing (typically within seconds) |
| Extracted Receipt Data | Stored on your device until you delete the receipt or uninstall the App |
| Mate Names | Stored on your device until you remove them or uninstall the App |
| Theme Preferences | Stored on your device until you uninstall the App |

## Your Rights and Choices

### Access and Control

You have full control over your data:

- **View**: All your data is visible within the App
- **Edit**: You can modify any receipt, item, or mate at any time
- **Delete**: You can delete individual receipts or remove mates
- **Export**: You can share receipts as PDF documents
- **Complete Deletion**: Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data

### No Account Required

Since we don't require account registration, there is no account to delete. Simply uninstall the App to remove all data.

## Children's Privacy

SplitMate is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information or require registration, the App can be safely used by users of all ages under parental supervision.

## International Data Transfers

Receipt images are processed on servers that may be located in different countries. All transfers are encrypted using industry-standard HTTPS protocols. Since we don't store your images or personal data on our servers, international data transfer concerns are minimal.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting the new Privacy Policy within the App

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when they are posted.

## California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have the right to:

- Know what personal information we collect (see "Information We Collect" above)
- Request deletion of your personal information (uninstall the App or delete data within the App)
- Not be discriminated against for exercising your privacy rights

Since we collect minimal data and store it only on your device, you already have full access to and control over your information.

## European Privacy Rights (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain rights under the General Data Protection Regulation:

- **Right of Access**: All your data is accessible within the App
- **Right to Rectification**: You can edit all data within the App
- **Right to Erasure**: You can delete data within the App or by uninstalling
- **Right to Data Portability**: You can export receipts as PDF documents
- **Right to Object**: Since we don't process data for marketing or profiling, this right is not applicable

**Legal Basis for Processing**: We process receipt images based on your consent (by choosing to use the scanning feature) and for the performance of the service you request.

## App Permissions

SplitMate requests the following device permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Camera | To take photos of receipts for scanning | Optional |
| Photo Library | To select existing receipt photos for scanning | Optional |

These permissions are only used for their stated purposes. You can use the App without granting these permissions by manually entering receipt items.
